Warning levels: 1 - definitely an error, 2 - most probably an error, 3 - possibly an error, 4 - most probably not an error. A -- relevant for verb profiles, B -- probably relevant, C -- relevant, but currently considered irreparable, D -- most probably not relevant, but otherwise rather important, E -- not relevant and not really important anyway
Other C-level issues: no PID slashes; no shared-dependent slashes; probable lack of empty verbs (почему столько грусти); probable failure to relocate all the dependents to a proper place when the tree is being changed (e.g. with numerals)
